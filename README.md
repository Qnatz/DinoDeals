## DinoDeals

Dino Deals alerts you to nearby deals by sending you a push notification when 
you are within a few blocks of a deal! Offers are aggregated from most of the 
major deals providers, giving you a wide variety of options to choose from!      

To use these example you will need a free Geoloqi developers account. You can signup at http://developers.geoloqi.com/pricing.
